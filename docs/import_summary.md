# XRAY Test Import Summary

## Overview
Successfully imported test cases from TestRail CSV files into JIRA XRAY for the MLBAPP project.

## Import Statistics

### Initial Import (First Run)
- **Total tests in CSV files**: 1,415
- **Successfully imported**: 681 tests (48.1%)
- **Failed**: 734 tests (51.9%)
- **Failure reason**: customfield_23269 (PreCondition field) not available on screen

### Re-import Attempts (After Fixing Custom Field Issue)
- **First re-run**: 104 additional tests imported
- **Second re-run**: 270+ additional tests imported (timed out)

### Current Status
- **Total tests in JIRA XRAY**: 1,060 tests (as of last check)
- **Success rate**: ~75% of total tests imported
- **Remaining**: ~355 tests still to be imported

## Key Issues Resolved

1. **XRAY Installation**: Confirmed XRAY was installed on MLBAPP project
2. **Issue Type Discovery**: Found correct issue type ID (16824) for "Xray Test" 
3. **Custom Field Error**: Removed problematic customfield_23269 that was causing failures
4. **Encoding**: Successfully converted CSV files from UTF-8 to ISO-8859-1

## Test Structure in XRAY

Tests were imported with:
- **Title**: From CSV "Title" field
- **Description**: Comprehensive description including:
  - Preconditions
  - Test steps (formatted)
  - Expected results
  - References
- **Priority**: Mapped from TestRail priority levels
- **Labels**: "imported-from-csv", "testrails-migration"
- **Test Repository Path**: Organized by surface (Home, News, Core App)

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Import**: Run the import script one more time to get the remaining ~355 tests
2. **Test Steps**: The test steps are currently in the description field. To add them as proper XRAY test steps, you'll need:
   - XRAY Cloud API credentials (separate from JIRA credentials)
   - Use the GraphQL API to add structured test steps
3. **Validation**: Review imported tests in XRAY to ensure data integrity
4. **Test Repository Organization**: May need to manually organize tests in XRAY's Test Repository structure

## Scripts Created

1. **prepare_csv_files.py**: Converts CSV encoding and analyzes data
2. **xray_import_script.py**: Main import script using JIRA REST API
3. **rerun_failed_tests.py**: Script to re-import only failed tests
4. **find_test_issuetype.py**: Utility to discover XRAY test issue type
5. **test_xray_graphql.py**: Test script for XRAY GraphQL API (requires additional auth)

## Command to Complete Import

```bash
export JIRA_EMAIL="douglas.mason@mlb.com"
export JIRA_BASE_URL="https://baseball.atlassian.net"
export ATLASSIAN_TOKEN="[YOUR_TOKEN]"

python3 rerun_failed_tests.py --continue-on-error --batch-size 300 \
  home_surface_prepared.csv mlbapp_prepared.csv news_surface_prepared.csv
```

## Lessons Learned

1. XRAY has a 1000 test limit per import operation
2. Custom fields must be on the appropriate screen to be set
3. XRAY Cloud GraphQL API requires separate authentication
4. Batch processing with delays helps avoid rate limiting
5. ISO-8859-1 encoding is required for special characters
