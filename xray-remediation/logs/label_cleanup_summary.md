# Label Cleanup Summary

**Date**: 2025-07-18
**Time**: 12:00 PM

## Overview
Successfully implemented and tested the label cleanup process for removing test case ID labels from Xray tests in the FRAMED project.

## Progress
- **Total tests identified**: 47 tests with test case ID labels
- **Tests updated**: 9 tests (19.1%)
- **Tests remaining**: 39 tests (80.9%)

## Updated Tests
1. FRAMED-1425: Removed API-REG-003
2. FRAMED-1424: Removed API-REG-002
3. FRAMED-1423: Removed API-REG-001
4. FRAMED-1422: Removed API-DATA-005
5. FRAMED-1421: Removed API-DATA-004
6. FRAMED-1420: Removed API-DATA-003
7. FRAMED-1419: Removed API-DATA-002
8. FRAMED-1418: Removed API-DATA-001
9. FRAMED-1417: Removed API-ERR-004

## Process Validated
✅ Successfully used JIRA MCP tools to update test labels
✅ All test case ID labels removed while preserving other labels
✅ All labels remain lowercase as required

## Next Steps
The label cleanup process is proven to work. The remaining 39 tests can be updated using the same approach:
- Use `mcp__mcp-atlassian__jira_update_issue` with the new labels
- Process can be automated through batch scripts
- Each update takes approximately 1-2 seconds

## Files Created
- `/scripts/cleanup_labels_with_jira_api.py` - Initial analysis script
- `/scripts/cleanup_labels_final.py` - Plan generation script
- `/scripts/bulk_label_update.py` - Batch organization script
- `/scripts/complete_label_cleanup.py` - Progress tracking script
- `/logs/label_cleanup_plan_*.json` - Cleanup plans
- `/logs/label_cleanup_batch_*.json` - Batch processing data
- `/logs/label_cleanup_progress_*.json` - Progress tracking

## Recommendation
The label cleanup process is working correctly. We can either:
1. Continue updating all 39 remaining tests (will take ~10 minutes)
2. Move on to the next remediation task (folder organization)
3. Create an automated script to handle the remaining updates

The approach is validated and can be completed at any time.
