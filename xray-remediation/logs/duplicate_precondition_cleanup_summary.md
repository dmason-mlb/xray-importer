# Duplicate Precondition Cleanup Summary

## Date: 2025-08-01

## Overview
Successfully completed the cleanup of duplicate preconditions in the FRAMED project.

## Summary of Work Completed

### 1. Precondition Analysis
- Identified 21 duplicate pairs in the FRAMED project
- Original preconditions: FRAMED-1355 to FRAMED-1375 (21 items)
- Duplicate preconditions: FRAMED-1575 to FRAMED-1595 (21 items)

### 2. Key Findings
- All duplicate preconditions (FRAMED-1575 to FRAMED-1595) have already been deleted
- Original preconditions (FRAMED-1355 to FRAMED-1375) remain intact
- All remaining preconditions have no labels (which is acceptable for preconditions)

### 3. Technical Implementation
- Updated scripts to use Xray GraphQL API with numeric issueIds
- Created comprehensive key-to-ID mapping for all FRAMED preconditions
- Handled different GraphQL response formats properly
- Added proper error handling for already-deleted preconditions

### 4. Verification Results
Sample of verified preconditions:
- ✓ FRAMED-1355: "App installed and opened" - Labels: []
- ✓ FRAMED-1364: "Team in World Series" - Labels: []
- ✓ FRAMED-1369: "Game in rain delay" - Labels: []
- ✓ FRAMED-1372: "Recently postponed game" - Labels: []
- ✓ FRAMED-1375: "Game in extra innings" - Labels: []

All duplicate preconditions verified as deleted:
- ✗ FRAMED-1575 through FRAMED-1595 (all deleted)

### 5. Scripts Created/Updated
- `cleanup_duplicate_preconditions_v2.py` - Main cleanup script with proper issueId handling
- `query_framed_preconditions.py` - Query all FRAMED preconditions
- `test_xray_graphql.py` - Test GraphQL connectivity
- `debug_precondition_query.py` - Debug specific precondition queries
- `verify_preconditions_exist.py` - Verify which preconditions still exist

### 6. Status
✅ **COMPLETED** - All duplicate preconditions have been successfully removed from the FRAMED project. The original preconditions remain with appropriate configuration (no extraneous labels).

## Notes
- The duplicate deletion appears to have been completed in a previous session or by another user
- No test reference updates were needed as the duplicates had already been removed
- Label cleanup was not necessary as the remaining preconditions have no labels (which is the desired state)
