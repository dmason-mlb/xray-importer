# Xray Folder Organization Complete

## Date: 2025-07-31

## Summary

Successfully completed the organization of all Xray tests and preconditions into appropriate folders within the Test Repository.

## Completed Actions

### 1. Preconditions Organization
- **Total Preconditions**: 23
- **Moved to**: `/Preconditions` folder
- **Status**: ✅ Complete - All 23 preconditions moved from root to dedicated folder

### 2. API Tests Organization
- **Total API Tests**: 15 (all with 'api' label)
- **Moved to**: `/Team Page/API Tests` folder
- **Status**: ✅ Complete - All 15 API tests moved from root to appropriate folder

### 3. Test Movement Example
Successfully tested the folder movement process with FRAMED-1294:
- Original location: `/` (root)
- New location: `/Team Page/API Tests/Error Handling`
- This validated the GraphQL mutation approach using `addTestsToFolder`

## Technical Implementation

### Scripts Created
1. **`move_test_to_folder.py`** - Single test movement utility
   - Uses GraphQL API for folder operations
   - Handles folder creation and test movement
   - Successfully tested with FRAMED-1294

2. **`organize_xray_folders.py`** - Comprehensive folder organization
   - Inventory mode: Analyzes current state without changes
   - `--move-preconditions`: Moves all preconditions to /Preconditions
   - `--create-folders`: Creates missing folder structures
   - `--move-tests`: Moves API tests to target folders
   - `--all`: Performs all operations

### Key GraphQL Mutations Used
- `createFolder` - Creates folder structures
- `addTestsToFolder` - Moves tests (automatically handles removal from previous folder)
- `addIssuesToFolder` - Moves preconditions and other issue types

## Final State

### Folder Structure
```
Test Repository/
├── Preconditions/          (23 items)
│   ├── FRAMED-1355 through FRAMED-1377
│
├── Team Page/
│   └── API Tests/          (15 items)
│       ├── FRAMED-1294 (in Error Handling subfolder)
│       ├── FRAMED-1419 through FRAMED-1425
│       └── Other API tests
```

### Verification
- All API tests properly categorized in `/Team Page/API Tests`
- All preconditions centralized in `/Preconditions`
- No tests remain in root folder requiring organization

## Next Steps

1. **Consider subcategorization** of API tests:
   - Error Handling tests
   - Authentication tests
   - Performance tests
   - Localization tests

2. **Organize functional tests** when they are created in Xray

3. **Document folder conventions** for future test creation

## Notes

- The Xray API doesn't have a direct "move" operation; instead, `addTestsToFolder` automatically handles the move by removing tests from their previous location
- Folders are created with full path (e.g., `/Team Page/API Tests` creates both levels if needed)
- The organization improves test discoverability and management in Xray's Test Repository view
